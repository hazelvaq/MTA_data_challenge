### MTA Data Challenge

Objectives:

1.  Start by borough and compare the bus speeds in each borough, then break it down to total miles traveled and average bus speedÂ 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
# reading in data 

bus_speed <- read_csv('data/mta_bus_speeds_2020.csv')

waiting_data <- read_csv('data/MTA_Bus_Customer_Journey-Focused_Metrics__2017-2019_20241008.csv')

# grouping by five boroughs: Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, Staten
bronx <- bus_speed %>% 
  filter(borough == 'Bronx')

brooklyn <- bus_speed %>% 
  filter(borough == 'Brooklyn')

manhattan <- bus_speed %>% 
  filter(borough == 'Manhattan')

queens <- bus_speed %>% 
  filter(borough == 'Queens')

staten <- bus_speed %>% 
  filter(borough  == 'Staten Island')
```

```{r, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}
exp <- bus_speed %>% 
  group_by(borough, trip_type,period,route_id) %>% 
  filter(trip_type == 'EXP'|trip_type == 'LCL/LTD') %>% 
  summarize(count = n())

length(unique(exp$route_id))

exp %>% 
  filter(trip_type == 'EXP') %>% 
  summarize(count = n())

exp1 <- bus_speed %>% 
  group_by(borough, trip_type) %>% 
  filter(trip_type == 'EXP') %>% 
  summarise(avg_time = mean(average_speed))
```

```{r}
# how much time (on average) does the average rider spend waiting 
# 80% of this data is truthful 

# wait time = additional_travel_time

waiting_data <- waiting_data %>% 
  rename(wait_time = additional_bus_stop_time)

waiting_data <- waiting_data %>% 
  filter(trip_type == 'EXP'| trip_type == 'LCL/LTD') %>% 
    group_by(borough, trip_type,period, month) %>% 
  summarize(mean_wait = mean(wait_time))


ggplot(data = waiting_data)+
  geom_line(aes(x = month, y = mean_wait, colour = borough), alpha = 0.5)+
  labs(x = 'Date',
       y = 'Average Wait Time (mins)')+
  facet_wrap(~borough)


# next step?
# four pie charts (how many people are waiting per borough), wait time
# averaged by year ; more constructive view of the wait time 

```

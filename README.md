# **2024 MTA Open Data Challenge**

### Project Summary 
Public transportation is an integral part of a daily routine for many New Yorkers, which inspired our in depth analysis on bus journey data. More specifically, we aimed to analyze and visualize data pertaining to the amount of bus routes in each borough, as well as different wait time metrics. Together, we used Github, R, and Canva to craft an informational brochure in hopes to educate riders about the bus waits across New York. Our analysis is presented through three visuals: a pie chart showing overall bus ridership by borough, a bar chart showing cumulative wait time by borough and bus route, and a line graph showing a time series of the average monthly wait time by borough and route type. All visuals shown used data from 2017-2019. Express and Local/Limited are the most common types within the five boroughs, so we narrowed in on data specifically pertaining to these two types of routes. The visuals in R were developed with an emphasis on user understanding and clarity. The colors in the visuals were used to represent significant colors found in the flag of each borough. The data used for the information in the brochure was the MTA Bus Customer Journey-Focused Metrics: 2017-2019. Specific methods of data wrangling and analysis can be found through our Github repository.
